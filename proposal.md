#### KMS Stats

##### Description
This project will give a visual of match stats of players competiting in this League of Legends tournament. Focusing on KDA stats and overall standings.

##### Use Case
The main use of this project is to keep fans, staff, and the esports athletes themselves. There are over 100 players, over 100 different champion selections, and close to 100 matches played out over both divisons that keeping track of stats is a long task currently being done by a very inefficent and time consuming plain spreadsheet.

##### Minimum Viable Product
 * Make an API, that can be called in another project. 
 * create a site that can display the stats and matches in a way that makes sense.
 * 

##### Tools for MVP
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)
 * custom made API in C#
 * Either normal javascript or react site. 

##### Additional Features
 * I would like to add more stat calculations (like gold leads, dragons secured, CS)
 * style to see at a glance who won matches
 * add a custom search bar to interact with API calls to filter

##### Tools for Additional Features
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your additional features. Be specific.)
